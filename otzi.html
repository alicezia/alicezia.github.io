      <h4 class="projectChapter">The research</h4>
      <p class="project-text">Starting from research on the young adults' target, we had to create a smart object that could help them during their daily routine. From the desk research, we analyzed how the main problem for young adults was stress-related. Both young workers and students struggle with concentration and low productivity during the day and the number of people that declared to be stressed was highly growing. After different in-field research, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, and design thinking activities, we identified four different key moments to help users: the awakening moment, the work or study hours, the spare time, and the sleeping hours and we decided to offer a solution that used both light and music to relax and help users during their daily routine.

      <h4 class="projectChapter">The concept</h4>
      <p class="project-text">The project started with a desk research on cultural heritage design and with an analysis of the museums' role in today’s society to better understand the experience offered to users. Starting from a theoretical background, the research shifted to the real experience, analysing the different media used by cultural entities before, during, and after the fruition moments and the users’ interaction with them. The in-field research was articulated in three different activities: intercepts, interviews and in-context observation carried out in three key museums in Milan: the Pinacoteca di Brera, the Palazzo Reale and the Fondazione Prada.</br></br>Through the in-field research emerged a very different approach during the overall experience, connected also to the heterogenic audience attending the exhibitions. During the visit, it also emerged a common reluctant attitude towards audioguides because of the uninteresting information collected, and a common readability problem towards information signs. Users expressed a desire to create a personal experience, moving around the museum’s rooms based on their interests. Once the visit was finished, the users were asked which media helped them more in the fruition and how they learned about the exhibition, pointing out a lack of information online or the difficulty in finding them.
