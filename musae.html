      <p class="project-text">In June 2018 the Apple spot directed by Spike Jonze was on everybody’s feed: “Hey Siri, put on something I like”, a simple phrase and FKA Twigs’s apartment was filled with Anderson Paak voice. Vocal speech recognition technology was slowly making room in people’s houses, and today the enhancement of the audio still continues undaunted. Starting from the analysis of this technological evolution, the project wonders if this could be the right time to let this shift encompass the museum system too. </br> </br>Exploiting audio as a learning tool, the project aims to create a new personal experience: the way today we learn things is very different, it evolved along with our lifestyle, and the ways in which we interact with contents are leading more and more to personalization and serendipity learning. By placing the museum at the center of the research, the project aims to create a system that could satisfy different visitors’ needs, trying to encourage a type of casual learning expanded over time.

      <h4 class="projectChapter">The research</h4>
      <p class="project-text">The project started with a desk research on cultural heritage design and with an analysis of the museums' role in today’s society to better understand the experience offered to users. Starting from a theoretical background, the research shifted to the real experience, analysing the different media used by cultural entities before, during, and after the fruition moments and the users’ interaction with them. The in-field research was articulated in three different activities: intercepts, interviews and in-context observation carried out in three key museums in Milan: the Pinacoteca di Brera, the Palazzo Reale and the Fondazione Prada.</br></br>Through the in-field research emerged a very different approach during the overall experience, connected also to the heterogenic audience attending the exhibitions. During the visit, it also emerged a common reluctant attitude towards audioguides because of the uninteresting information collected, and a common readability problem towards information signs. Users expressed a desire to create a personal experience, moving around the museum’s rooms based on their interests. Once the visit was finished, the users were asked which media helped them more in the fruition and how they learned about the exhibition, pointing out a lack of information online or the difficulty in finding them.
